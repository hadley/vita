	Abstract = {This article develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for this article are available online on the journal web site.},}

	Abstract = {
	Conventional boxplots are useful displays for conveying rough
  information about the central 50% and the extent of data. For small-sized
  data sets (n < 200), detailed estimates of tail behavior beyond the
  quartiles may not be trustworthy, so the information provided by boxplots is
  appropriately somewhat vague beyond the quartiles, and the expected number
  of "outliers" of size n is often less than 10. Larger
  data sets (n ~ 10,000-100,000) afford more precise estimates of
  quantiles beyond the quartiles, but conventional boxplots do not show this
  information about the tails, and, in addition, show large numbers of
  extreme, but not unexpected, observations.

  The letter-value plot addresses both these shortcomings: (1) it conveys more
  detailed information in the tails using letter values, but only to the
  depths where the letter values are reliable estimates of their corresponding
  quantiles and (2) "outliers" are labeled as those observations beyond the
  most extreme letter value. All features shown on the letter-value plot are
  actual observations, thus remaining faithful to the principles that governed
  Tukey's original boxplot. We illustrate letter-value plots on real data
  (univariate and bivariate) that demonstrate their usefulness, particularly
  for large data sets. All graphics are created using R, and
  code and data are available in the supplementary materials.

	Abstract = {Support vector machines (SVM) offer a theoretically wellfounded approach to automated learning of pattern classifiers. They have been proven to give highly accurate results in complex classification problems, for example, gene expression analysis. The SVM algorithm is also quite intuitive with a few inputs to vary in the fitting process and several outputs that are interesting to study. For many data mining tasks (e.g., cancer prediction) finding classifiers with good predictive accuracy is important, but understanding the classifier is equally important. By studying the classifier outputs we may be able to produce a simpler classifier, learn which variables are the important discriminators between classes, and find the samples that are problematic to the classification. Visual methods for exploratory data analysis can help us to study the outputs and complement automated classification algorithms in data mining. We present the use of tour-based methods to plot aspects of the SVM classifier. This approach provides insights about the cluster structure in the data, the nature of boundaries between clusters, and problematic outliers. Furthermore, tours can be used to assess the variable importance. We show how visual methods can be used as a complement to crossvalidation methods in order to find good SVM input parameters for a particular data set.},

	Abstract = {How do we find structure in multidimensional data when computer screens are only two-dimensional? One approach is to project the data onto one or two dimensions. Projections are used in classical statistical methods like principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis. PCA (e.g., Johnson and Wichern 2002) chooses a projection to maximize the variance. Fisher's linear discriminant (e.g., Johnson and Wichern 2002) chooses a projection that maximizes the relative separation between group means. Projection pursuit (PP) (e.g., Huber 1985) generalizes these ideas into a common strategy, where an arbitrary function on projections is optimized. The scatterplot matrix (e.g., Becker and Cleveland 1987) also can be considered to be a projection method. It shows projections of the data onto all pairs of coordinate axes, the 2-D marginal projections of the data. These projection methods choose a few select projections out of infinitely many.},

With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification; superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales; add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression; save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse; create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots; approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot.

  This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.},

In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of `discoveries' is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the `lineup' popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the `Rorschach' inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students' statistical thinking.},

The GGobi pipeline is extensible and mutable at runtime. The rggobi package, an interface from the R language to GGobi, has been augmented with a low-level interface that supports the customization of interactive data visualizations through the extension and manipulation of the GGobi pipeline. The large size of the GGobi API has motivated the use of the RGtk2 code generation system to create the low-level interface between R and GGobi.

	A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This paper builds on Wilkinson (2006), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2.

  The topics in this paper include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The paper concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems''.

	Abstract = {How do we know if what we see is really there? When visualizing data, how do we avoid falling into the trap of apophenia where we see patterns in random noise? Traditionally, infovis has been concerned with discovering new relationships, and statistics with preventing spurious relationships from being reported. We  pull these opposing poles closer with two new techniques for rigorous statistical inference of visual discoveries. The ``Rorschach'' helps the analyst calibrate their understanding of uncertainty and the ``line-up'' provides a protocol for assessing the significance of visual discoveries, protecting against the discovery of spurious structure.},

The framework, with extensions, is sufficient to encompass over 20 visualisations previously described in fields of statistical graphics and infovis, including bar charts, mosaic plots, treemaps, equal area plots and fluctuation diagrams.}}

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with different, and new, approaches to tours of data. This paper contains animations that can be viewed using the Adobe Acrobat PDF viewer.},

This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored.

  The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.},
