	Abstract = {This paper presents the reshape package for R, which provides a common framework for many types of data reshaping and aggregation. It uses a paradigm  of `melting' and `casting', where the data are `melted' into a form which distinguishes measured and identifying variables, and then `cast' into a new shape, whether it be a data frame, list, or high dimensional array.  The paper includes an introduction to the conceptual framework, practical advice for melting and casting, and a case study.}

	abstract = {
	A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the “scatterplot”) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This paper builds on Wilkinson (2006), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2.

  The topics in this paper include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The paper concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical “poems”.

	Abstract = {We propose a new framework for visualising tables of counts, proportions and probabilities. We call our framework product plots, alluding to the computation of area as a product of height and width, and the statistical concept of generating a joint distribution from the product of conditional and marginal distributions. The framework, with extensions, is sufficient to encompass over 20 visualisations previously described in fields of statistical graphics and infovis, including bar charts, mosaic plots, treemaps, equal area plots and fluctuation diagrams.}
